          Vietnamese cuisine is the name of the method of food processing, the
          principle of mixing spices and the general eating habits of the
          Vietnamese community and ethnic groups in Vietnam. Although there are
          many differences, Vietnamese cuisine still includes the most general
          meaning to refer to all the dishes that are popular in the ethnic
          minority community but have been relatively popular in the Vietnamese
          community. In Vietnamese culture, eating and drinking is an art, it is
          not only to meet the basic requirements of people but also has a close
          relationship with the lifestyle and national traditions, which is very
          clearly shown through the tools used in the meal, how to behave with
          people while eating. Therefore, eating and drinking also proves the
          history and formation of the culture of Vietnam. The dishes through
          each period speak to the life and people of that period and of the
          land – where each dish was born. Vietnam cuisine has earned its
          reputation over the years with the famous Pho and Banh Mi. But that is
          not the whole essence of Vietnamese culinary culture. From the North
          to the very South of this small but beautiful country, traditional
          Vietnamese food with an elite reflection of the culture is phenomenal.
          Each delicacy is formed from the lives of Vietnamese people all over
          the nation.

        <h3>Vietnamese cuisine at a glance</h3>
        <p>
          It is undeniable that food plays a crucial role in a country’s
          culture. Traditional cuisine is passed down from generation to
          generation – keeping the good old flavors to this modern day. <br />
          Vietnamese food is widely applauded for its balancing flavors as it is
          a symphony of protein, spices, herbs, vegetables, and even fruits. No
          wonder people have also known Vietnamese food as one of the healthiest
          cuisines in the world. <br />
          There is something really tempting about Vietnamese dishes that most
          people can’t resist – even the celebrity chef Gordon Ramsey, the
          famous American chef Anthony Bourdain, and the British chef Jamie
          Oliver. The distinct and oddly satisfying tastes of Vietnamese cuisine
          have traveled all around the world. <br />
          Rice (or rice flour) plays the main part in every Vietnamese meal – no
          matter it is a dish from the North, the Central, or the South.
          However, the side dishes of each region are what set them apart and
          make them interesting. <br />
          The dishes from the North tend to have a subtle and tender seasoning.
          Northern citizens are long known for their attractions towards dishes
          with pure, soft flavors (and maybe a little sour too).<br />
          Central’s food is full of surprises as it is associated with intense,
          salty, and hot flavors. Even the food here leans toward reddish or
          orangish shades. A remarkable trait of the Central dishes is that
          these recipes intertwine refined royal cuisine and ready-to-go street
          food. A pinch of exquisite taste, a little luxury, and a bit of modest
          flavor – all mingle together in one dish.<br />
          It is such a big fault to mention Vietnamese cuisine without
          discussing the dishes of Southern people. Richness and sweetness are
          the main flavors of Southern dishes. They tend to use sugar and
          coconut juice to sweeten the food.<br />
          But what makes the cuisine of this small country so remarkable and
          captivating at the same time? Is it the harmony of flavors? Is it the
          rich history and culture? Perhaps each one will have their own answers
          once they get a bite of these scrumptious dishes. <br />
          In the next parts, let us guide you through some of the most delicious
          dishes that Vietnamese cuisine has to offer.<br />
